* Source Data: https://data.oecd.org/gdp/gross-domestic-product-gdp.htm

Short Description
* The code in this repository is an adaption of the code from the source above.
* The data used for the visualisation is a subset of the dataset downloaded from the OECD website. I chose to visualize the development of two time series, GDP and Investment, in 5 countries (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada and Denmark) from 1982 to 2016.
* The visualization is interactive. The timelines are per default transparent. The user then has the option to highlight individual series or multiple series at once.
* The two visualizations are interlinked. Even though they are not visible simultaneously, a selection made for one chart is transferable to the other.
